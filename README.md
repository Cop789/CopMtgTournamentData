This is a little project I made just to see what decks are performing well at tournaments.
The main value I am geting here is what decks have a higher day 2 conversion rate and what decks have a good matchup against each other.
I get the data for this project from melee.gg and pulling the each match history.

Currently this only works for Regional Championships, will add Pro Tours when I find a good way to filter out the drafts at Pro Tours.
